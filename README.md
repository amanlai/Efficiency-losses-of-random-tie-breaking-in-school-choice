# Efficiency-losses-of-random-tie-breaking-in-school-choice

Deferred Acceptance with random tie-breaking is a very attractive solution concept in school choice. However, it is well known in the literature that it has an efficiency cost. We design an integer program that solves for constrained ordinal efficiency in the ex post stable class to measure the magnitude of the cost of random tie-breaking and ex post stability. In the process, we characterize stability, constrained ordinal efficiency and constrained rank efficiency in the ex post stable class as solutions to integer programming problems. Our simulation results show that random tie-breaking has a significantly larger efficiency cost than ex post stability. In fact, as the market grows larger, the cost of ex post stability shrinks faster than that of random tie-breaking.
